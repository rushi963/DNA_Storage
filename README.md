# DNA Storage using Akhmetov Encoding

Data is growing at an alarming rate and to keep up with it we need a better storage technology and this is where DNA comes into the picture. DNA has extremely long half-life and unlike digital media it is not prone to degradation. Recently scientists were able to store 215 petabytes per gram of DNA. This project is an implemention of the paper "A highly parallel strategy for storage of digital information in living cells" by Azat Akhmetov, Andrew D.Ellington and Edward M.Marcotte. The paper discusses a
new encoding strategy which helps in detecting and correcting errors. Lempel Ziv Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) compression and edit-distance libraries are used in the implementation.
